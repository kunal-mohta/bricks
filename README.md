# bricks

Trying to recreate the classical game "bricks"

Significance of the project:- 
- Helped me to familiarize myself with [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/)
- How to watch **SASS** files for changes and simultaneously generating CSS files
- Collision detection in **JavaScript** games

Noticeable features of the game:-
- The speed of the ball increases with time making it difficult for the user as he/she succeeds in the game
- To make it more realistic, I haven't just used the plain [Law of Reflection](http://farside.ph.utexas.edu/teaching/302l/lectures/node127.html). Instead I have made the collision to occur in such a way that if the ball hits near the center of the user bar, then the reflection angle will be less than the actual reflection angle and if the ball hits near the ends of the user bar, then it would be more than the actual angle.
